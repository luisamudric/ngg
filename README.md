# Number Guessing Game

# The requirements:

Write a script for a number guessing game. The player should have ten 
attempts to guess the number correctly before the game ends. 

A new number should be generated after each guess. 

Each time the player guesses, they should be given feedback as to whether 
or not they have the answer correct and if not, whether it was higher or lower 
than the correct number. If they guess correctly, the player should be 
awarded a point. 

When ten attempts have been made, the playerâ€™s overall score should then 
be printed to the console.

# My notes:

There seems to be an error in the code. It seems to be that when the user enters the correct number, the majority of the times the code provides the user with the incorrect feedback. Whereas, other times, it provides the user with the correct feedback. So the code keeps running in a loop unless the user inputs anything other than a number between 1 and 10.
